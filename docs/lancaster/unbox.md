## Surface Marks and Cleaning

You may notice light scratch marks, burn marks, or a protective oil coating on the aluminium parts. **These are completely normal and easy to clean.** They happen as part of the laser cutting and bending process during manufacturing.

To clean off the burn marks and protective oil coating, use a sponge with warm, soapy water.

To polish out the scratch marks, use a brillio-pad or scotch brite.
