## Surface Marks and Cleaning

Some aluminium parts may arrive with minor surface scratches, discoloration, or a light protective oil coating. These marks are a byproduct of the laser cutting and bending process. We know they’re not ideal — but unfortunately, they’re unavoidable at this stage of manufacturing.

To clean and improve the finish:

Use a sponge with warm, soapy water to remove any discoloration and oil residue.

For surface scratches, gently polish the part using a Brillo pad or Scotch-Brite. This will help blend the scratches and improve the overall appearance.

These steps are optional but can help improve the final finsh.
