The bracket is made up of the pivot mount - (which is what the Lancaster will bolt too) and the wall bracket.

Slide the pivot mount into the wall bracket as shown in the below photo.

Add in the 4x M6 screws, **keep these loose** as they allow you to move the mount around as you want to position the Lancaster.
