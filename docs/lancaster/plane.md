## Wing brackets

Start by fixing the left and right wing brackets onto the fuselage.

Keep all screw hex heads on the same same side and fit all screws before tightening any of them up - this ensures they all fit into their holes.

Start with 1 screw at either end to make things easy.

All of the plane components are fixed with M6x16mm screws, the washer should be place behind the nylock nut as shown:

You'll need a 4mm hex key and a 10mm spanner or socket to tighten them up.

Fit the remaining 4 bolts, then tighten them all up together.

!!!Tip
    If you have access to a bench vice, it'll make assembly a little easier.

## Wings

Turn the plane fuselage upside down.

Place the wings on the wing brackets so the propeller tabs face the front of the fuselage and all bolt holes line up.

Fit all 8x screws loose before tightening them up.

Next we'll fit the mounting bracket. Ensure the 10mm hex bolt is fitted before attaching this to the plane - it won't fit after it's installed.

You may need to squeeze the bracket in slightly to get all the holes to line up. This is normal. Start with two screws in one side first.

## Tails

With the plane still upside down, we'll fit the tail brackets and fins.

The flange should point down, and the flat portion of the fin should be at the rear of the plane.

Once the tail brackets have been fitted, we can fit the fins.

## Engines

Keeping the plan upside down, we will fit all four plane engines.

Ensure the long edge is central with the propeller flange.
